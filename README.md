# Road-Line-Detection

This project is designed to detect road lines in images and video feeds from a camera mounted on a vehicle.

# Requirements
To run this project, you will need the following software and libraries:

Python 3
OpenCV
NumPy

# Results
The road line detection script will display the image or video feed with the detected road lines overlaid on top.
Some parameters need to be changed for media of different sizes and road lanes with different orientation.
